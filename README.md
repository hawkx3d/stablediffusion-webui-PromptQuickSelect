# Prompt Quick Select with Wildcard Support

**Dropdown menus for actions and wildcards â€“ prompt engineering made simple.**

PromptHelper is a Stable Diffusion Forge WebUI extension that makes prompt building faster. It adds two dropdown menus directly under the **Styles** box, allowing you to quickly insert or remove **actions** (from `action.json`) and **wildcards** (from `.txt` collections).
